## How to Use this Program
#### Begin by placing all unorganized files within the designated 'Pictures' folder.
### Customizing the Source Folder
*The program retrieves files from a designated folder for processing. To modify this location, follow these steps:*
1. *Locate the* <b>folderPath</b> *variable within your <ins>main.py</ins> file, typically around line 33 (line numbers may vary slightly).*
2. *Update the value assigned to* <b>folderPath</b> *with the actual path to your folder containing the unorganized files. In your case, replace the path with the location of your <ins><b>'Pictures'</b></ins> folder.*
